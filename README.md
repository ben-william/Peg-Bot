# Peg-Bot
A stablecoin monitor for the cryptocurrency community

## WIP
This project is a work in progress. It was inspired by the recent debacle surrounding Luna/UST.

## Roadmap

### MVP Version
Local running code that can track and correctly push notifications.

### Hosted MVP
Host the basic version. I'd like to try something besides Heroku as I've already worked with that. Perhaps GCP?

### V2 
I'd like to incorporate the following for V2:
* database to house users, user preferences (notification thresholds), price/mcap/volume histories per stablecoin
* start tracking total stablecoin marketcap as a basis for market cashflows / investor risk tolerance
* start tracking micro-cap stablecoins 

### V3 
* Basic website for user signup
* Basic charts of stablecoin metrics
